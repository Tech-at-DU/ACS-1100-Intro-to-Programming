# Here are three variables that store data representing scores for a video game

my_score = 30
my_friend_score = 50
high_score = 60

# Let's use variable reassignment to update the scores!
my_score = my_friend_score
my_friend_score = high_score
my_score = 55
high_score = 99
my_score = high_score

# Draw a variable table to visualize how these variables' values are changing!
# Use a block comment.
