Let's practice deleting values from dicitionaries.

To delete we use the del keyword
'''

# Welcome Back to StockY
# Here is our inventory.

inventory = {
	'Jordan 1' : 1,
	'Yeezy'    : 8,
	'Air Max'  : 10,
	'SB Dunk'  : 5,
	'Cortez'   : 20,
	'Jordan 6' : 100 
}

# TODO: 
# We no longer sell Yeezys, so let's delete that item 
# from our inventory


# Let's print our dictionary to see the changes 

print(inventory)
