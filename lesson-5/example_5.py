#Imagine you are creating a program to give advice about 
# what activities to do based on the weather

#TODO: Write some code to check what the weather is 
# today and print out what to do if the weather is sunny 
# then print "Let's go to the park!" if the weather is 
# foggy print "Let's go see a movie" if the weather is 
# rainy print "Let's read a book indoors" else print 
# "Going out to eat is good in any weather"

weather = "cloudy"
