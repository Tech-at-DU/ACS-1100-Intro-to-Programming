	return new_number

add_ten(60)
add_ten(30)

# How can you save the values returned by the add_ten function? 

# Print the values returned by the two calls to add_ten above:

# Use add_ten to add 10 to the total of the first two calls to add_ten. 
# The answer should be 120. Print the result below.
